  title: Ambulance Analytics - FHIR API
  description: "## Overview\nUse this API to submit ambulance call centre data, this is compiled from [Electronic Patient Record](https://transformation.sth.nhs.uk/programme/epr/) (EPR) and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) to the national electronic database. This data is stored by our Data Processing Service (DPS) for analysis and review by NHS England and local ambulance trusts.\n\nYou can:\n  - post ambulance response records individually or in batches\n\nYou cannot:\n  - read any of the records stored in DPS\n\nThis is a representations of how this API fits into the solution.\n\n![Ambulance Overview](https://github.com/RyanThomas1214/MyFiles/blob/master/AmbulanceOverview-Page-3.png?raw=true)\n\n## Legal Use\nThis API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).\n\n## Related APIs\nThe [Messaging Exchange for Social care and Health (MESH)](https://meshapi.docs.apiary.io/#) API will also be required for delivering messages and files to registered recipients.\n\n## API status and roadmap\nThis API is in [private beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:\n * we might make breaking changes, but only if we can't avoid it, and we'll give advance notice\n * we can't guarantee availability or performance\n * only available to a small group of ambulance trusts in England\n\nThis API is currently available for sandbox testing, integration testing and production use.\n\nTo see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=allexceptdone&tag=ambulance-analytics&deleted=0#controls).\n\nIf you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n## Technology\nThis API uses HTTP POST to submit data.\n\nThe data payload conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.\n\nSpecifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core),\nwhich is built on FHIR Release 4. Read the specification for the [message payload](https://simplifier.net/guide/FHIRImplementationGuideTemplateambulance/Overview).\n\n## Network access\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network). For more details, see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n## Security and authorisation\n\nThis API is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis) - we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.In particular, it uses signed JWT authentication -you authenticate your application by sending a signed JSON web token (JWT) to our OAuth 2.0 authorisation server.For more details see [Application-restricted RESTful APIs - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication).\n\n### Detailed integration instructions\nThis API follows the OAuth 2.0 protocol, the authentication method (unattended access) is designed for authentication without a user being present. You can authenticate by sending a JSON Web Token (JWT) token signed with a private key with the RS512 algorithm.\n\nOnce the target server receives the JWT token it will lookup for a set of public keys from either a URL or store. The target server will then check each public key until it finds one that matches.\n\nThe current flow to use this API is:\n- POST request with a signed JWT token and other required headers to the /token endpoint\n- POST request with the access token in the Authorisation header to the /submission endpoint\n\n### Generate a Private/Public Key Pair\nRun the following commands on the command prompt to generate a private/public key pair on a UNIX system (Linux, MacOS):\n\n    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f jwtRS512.key\n    openssl rsa -in jwtRS512.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwtRS512.key.pub\nThe resulting files, jwtRS512.key and jwtRS512.key.pub are the private and public keys, respectively.\n\nCreate a Key Identifier (KID), a unique name to identify the key pair in use. This KID will be used to refer to the key pair when constructing and posting the JWT.\n\n### Register a Public Key with API Management\nEmail [API Management](mailto://api.management@nhs.net) with your **KID** and your **public key** as an attachment. The unattended access public key management process is currently not self-service, however we do aim to provide this in the future as part of our [product roadmap](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/107454/application-registration-selfservice).\n\nYour public key will be associated with your test app in the environment of your choice. You will receive an email once this has been completed successfully. Now use your KID and private key to sign your JWT requests.\n\n### Generate a JWT and sign it\nA JWT is a token that consists of three parts: a header, a payload and a signature. The header details the algorithm and token type. The payload consists of data (detailed below) and the signature is used to verify the token itself. More details on [generating a JWT Token](https://jwt.io/).\n\n**Note:** We strongly recommend that you use a library to generate your JWT tokens, as this can be a complicated process to perform by hand.\n\n#### Header\nThe header for the JWT details the authentication and token type used. The algorithm used is RS512, matching the algorithm used to generate the private/public key pair.\n\n##### Example:\n\t{\n\t  \"alg\": \"RS512\",\n\t  \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n\t  \"kid\": \"test\"\n\t}\n\n| Field | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Type   |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| alg   | The algorithm (alg) used to generate the private key used to sign the JWT.

To submit the data into DPS, use this OAuth 2.0 access token in subsequent requests to the /submission endpoint. The request fields are detailed below.\n\n \n| Field                 | Description                                                                      | Type   |\n| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------|\n| client_assertion_type | This must be the value “urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer”. | String |\n| client_assertion      | This must be set to the value of the generated JWT token.                        | String |\n| grant_type            | This must be the value “client_credentials”.                                     | String |\n\n### Using the access token to submit data into DPS\nOnce you have received the ”access_token”, you can make data submissions to DPS via POST request to the /submission endpoint, with the authorisation header set to bearer and the access token.\n\n## Environments and testing\n| Purpose          | URL                                                       |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Sandbox          | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/ambulance-analytics`  |\n| Integration test | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/ambulance-analytics`      |\n| Production       | `https://api.service.nhs.uk/ambulance-analytics`          |\n\n### Sandbox testing\nOur [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n- is for early developer testing\n- only covers a limited set of scenarios\n- is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates\n- is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation\n\nFor more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.\n\n### Integration testing\nOur [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):\n- is for formal integration testing\n\n## Onboarding\n\nYou need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.\n\nTo onboard for this API, follow the [Supplier Conformance Assessment List](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process#onboard-using-the-supplier-conformance-assessment-list-scal-process) (SCAL) process.\n\nWhen following the SCAL process, note that:\n\n* In step 8: you need to review and complete the Ambulance Analytics API risk log to show that you have understood and mitigated the various risks. You might be asked to provide some evidence to prove that controls have been put in place. You’ll find the risk log embedded within the Ambulance Analytics API tab in the SCAL.\n* In step 10: when you complete the Service Desk Registration Form, send it to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\n* In step 11: submit your completed SCAL to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\n* In step 14: to request production access, contact us at [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\n"
